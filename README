# Better Fletching Table

> Adds a GUI to Fletching Tables, along with custom Arrows and items!

---

## Motivation

The Villager workstations all got GUIs: the Smithing Table, the Cartography Table, the Grindstone, even the Loom. Even the Composter, useless as it is, has some functionality as a Bone Meal source for Peaceful Mode.

Except the **Fletching Table**. My poor boy.

Besides that, <>Minecraft's ranged projectiles mechanics, tier progression and options are very shallow and limited**. You always only go for a maxed Power enchanted Bow with regular arrows just to pick up the quick and safe KO on mobs. No one practically crafts or mains the crossbow given the choice. The other arrow types are of such**inconsequential effects** that no one bothers to craft them, so they just smacked a band-aid on the symptom by liberally providing Spectral Arrows and Tipped Arrows from Piglin/Villager Trading.

## Design

To introduce interesting ranged combat mechanics, we must first introduce a way to obtain them. Silly vanilla crafting doesn't allow NBT outputs, so we'll have to make our own custom GUI!

**The new Fletching Table GUI is a familiar 3x3 crafting grid** that allows us to craft all the new special custom items.

The new Arrow types should give **wider options of meaningful choices** for the player to choose, whilst requiring materials that are not necessarily plentiful, but an adventure itself to obtain. The **Rockets ammunition and Piercing buff** should give players a reason to use the Crossbow. **Improving on old boring mechanics** and **introducing new utility items** will force players to rethink their style of play and come up with creative new strategies!

This data pack was designed to work alongside my other data pack, [Cycle Offhand Arrows](https://github.com/chuangcaleb/cycle-offhand-arrows), which allows you to**cycle through arrow types in the offhand slot by using your offhand key whilst holding a Bow or Crossbow**! ﻿I heavily advocate this utility data pack in general for any world!

## Cross/Bow Enchantments Rework

### Power Enchantment Rework

>Power accelerates your arrows' velocity

The vanilla Bow enchantment to always get is Power. Just like Sharpness, it's a flat simple damage increase, who doesn't want that? That's BORING. Power also makes combat boring once you start two-shotting every 10-heart mob.

WIth this data pack, Power works differently; **a Power bow now makes your arrows fly faster.**

This opens up a very different playstyle compared to Crossbows, or even vanilla Bows. The difference is most noticeable on partially-charged shots; a Power V Bow on minimal charge flies as fast as a fully-charged Power I Bow!

And, with a similar damage output, people may opt for the Crossbow now! All without completely scraping the Power enchantment, but instead recontextualizing it.

Yet, I recognize that increased arrow damage is important because you barely take any damage in full Diamond/Netherite from Arrow from a regular-damage-unenchanted Bow.

Arrow damage is calculated as:

> Effective Damage Value = Arrow `damage` NBT Value x Velocity on Impact

Since we are going to crazy values of initial velocity, we have to scale down the arbitrary damage coefficient of Power V arrows.

Yet, as you can see, Power V will still do much more damage than a Power I Arrow. So, still enchant your bows with Power.

And, if you haven't noticed, there is a noticeable jump from no Power to Power I. So, getting Power I on any bow makes a huge difference!

Credit: I'm copying all these amazing ideas. I saw this idea on a Data Pack on planetminecraft years ago, titled something like "Acceleration — an enchantment that makes your arrows go faster!" It was an amazing idea and I tried hard but can't find it. So I had to code it from scratch. Took me a week. Please help claim the credits if anyone finds it!

### Piercing Enchantment Rework

> Piercing makes arrows go through blocks

Nobody gets the Crossbow because of its lame enchantments. Namely, the Piercing enchantment. It's supposed to be to Crossbows what Power is to Bows. But it never took off. You are more likely to fight 1v1s, so flat Power damage makes more sense; and even in a crowd of mobs/players, you just run until you pick them off one-by-one.

But, I came across [AKA__Fox](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/aka__fox)'s [Piercing Arrows Can Go Through Blocks Data Pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/piercing-arrows-can-go-though-blocks). Wow.

This gives Piercing such an amazing and unique use case, especially in PVP when players hide behind blocks. It can work especially well with Spectral Arrows' glowing. It scales and pierces more blocks according to the Piercing level. On top of being able to pierce through Shields, it gives one more a reason to use Crossbows for their Piercing enchantment! Imagine an enemy hiding behind a wall, but you shoot him with a Piercing-enchanted Spectral Arrow, highlighting his location and movements.

I want to just wholesale rip it off. So I asked for permission, then I did.

If you liked this particular feature and found it interesting, please send that Data Pack some Diamonds and Hearts, because I literally just ripped off the entire mechanic. But my Data Pack is made so much more complete with it.

#### Piercing — Caveats

> TL;DR the system implemented for this isn't perfect with data packs, but should work 95% of the time.

Because of how entities and hitboxes work, there is one issue/bug. If an entity/player stands right up against the block that is being pierced, the piercing arrow will not hit them but instead will go/"phase" through them.

The piercing arrow gets teleported right out the opposite side of that block but inside the entity/player hitbox. Since the piercing arrow starts the tick being inside the hitbox already, it doesn't count as a collision. You can try this out for yourself: trigger an arrow-loaded dispenser facing you. Of course, you get hit by the arrows, but if you stand right up against the dispenser... the arrows go through you. It's a weird Minecraft bug. But this is the best we can do, imo this feature should be vanilla!

## The Fletching Table

A complete overhaul of the vanilla block, placing a Fletching Table will now spawn a mini-Crafting-Table on the top face of the vanilla Fletching Table block. Shift+Right-Click to open the Fletching Table GUI, and breaking the block will drop it like any other block.

The Fletching(?)/Crafting interface works beautifully — it has multiplication of your materials up till an output stack of 64, with a coefficient according to the recipe. You can even Shift-Click the output to craft the whole stack! Output items are spawned on top of the table.

### Fletching Table — Notes

I've also disabled regular crafting for the Cross/Bow/Spectral/Arrow/Target items, locking them behind the progression wall of a very cheap two Planks and two Flint (this can be disabled).

Hint: You can Shift+Right-Click to place a regular vanilla Fletching Table without the GUI and tracking entities, if you want to use it as a decorative block!

Naturally generated Fletching Tables will not have the mini-Crafting-Table on the top face, and will act like vanilla Fletching Tables. Conversion to the custom Fletching Table only occurs when placing a Fletching Table block, so you can break the naturally generated Fletching Tables first and place them!

Since the custom Fletching Table actually uses an invisible Llama as its GUI behind-the-scenes, simply right-clicking it will cause you to mount it. Awkward. You will be automatically dismounted with commands. Just remember to Shift+Right-Click!

And I guess if you want, since it is technically not a GUI but an Inventory, you could store stuff in the Fletching Table. Don't forget to pick up after yourselves!

### Flaming Arrow

> Fire Arrows without the Flame enchantment

Flaming Arrows are such a cool arrow type, having the ability to set mobs on fire, as well as light up TNT. But that's all locked behind the Flame enchantment, which you only can unlock at higher enchantments. Now you can shoot Fire arrows with regular unenchanted Bows or Crossbows!

Flaming Arrow, a new arrow, is crafted by 1 Arrow + 1 Fire Charge → 1 Flaming Arrow.

I might change this to Torches, I recognize this gets locked behind the Blaze Powder/Nether Fortress/Nether/Diamond Pickaxe wall, but I like giving Fire Charges another use. Torches are too cheap, too.

### Phantom Arrow

> Antigravity arrows with Piercing II

The gimmick is simple: the Phantom Arrow is unaffected by gravity.

Furthermore, on top of the Piercing enchantment rework, I thought to just add on the Piercing enchantment/NBT to Phantom Arrows! Phantom Arrows get automatic Piercing II. Now you can shoot Piercing arrows from bows that can penetrate multiple enemies AND hit through shields AND go through blocks!

The Phantom Arrow is crafted by replacing the Feather in the typical Arrow recipe shape with a Phantom Membrane (1 Flint + 1 Stick + 1 Phantom Membrane → 2 Phantom Arrows). They come in multiples of 2, since Phantom Membranes should be hard to come by, but they are very useful! If players want to use this unique arrow type and have Phantom Arrows in bulk, they will need to farm Phantoms!

The Phantom Arrow is an arrow brought forward from the old Improved Fletching Tables data pack. There are a variety of applications, but it's generally easier to hit any target, especially precisely hitting long-distance shots or evasive enemies, without needing to account for gravity.

### TNT Rocket

> A Firework Rocket that explodes with a TNT blast

Ah yes, everyone loves explosions. Of course I added a ranged explosive option!

TNT Rockets are crafted from 1 Firework Rocket (must have at least one Large Ball pattern) + 1 TNT → 1 TNT Rocket! Just point, shoot, and watch the particles and blocks explode with the equivalent firepower of a TNT block!

I made the choice to not have explosive arrows because there are already so many arrow types, plus since Bows cannot shoot Firework Rockets, this provides another incentive for players to use the Crossbow! I have also required a Large Ball pattern on the Firework Rocket to make it slightly more expensive/tedious; besides, the firework explosion on impact adds to the flair!

I have also made them unstackable/stacks of 1. This is because it is wayyy to OP to carry multiple stacks of 64 bazooka rockets. I'd like them to stack to 4 ideally, but data packs require so many workarounds for inventory stack limitation. Also, a Multishot Crossbow will only shoot 1 TNT Rocket from the middle projectile slot instead of 3.

### Light Underwater Missile

> Low-cost projectiles for underwater combat!

After making TNT Rockets relatively expensive, I've also added Light Underwater Missiles: they are cheap TNT Rockets that are meant for underwater combat!

These are crafted very cheap with 1 Gunpowder + 1 Kelp + 1 Dried Kelp → 1 Light Underwater Missile. They have an ExplosionPower of 3, but only when it explodes underwater. If it explodes elsewhere, it fizzles and drops itself as an item. However, these Missiles stack up to 64 and unlike Arrows, they are not affected by gravity in water, so you could spend them lavishly just like how you can spam cheap regular Arrows on land!

### Target Block & TNT Target Block

> Volatile red-explosive-barrels!

Target blocks have their crafting recipe moved over to the Fletching Table, since they are arrow/shooting-related. As an added utility, you can use Dried Kelp Blocks in the place of Hay Blocks to craft Target blocks!

But more importantly: the TNT Target block. Isn't it so thrilling when a bunch of enemies group up, and you shoot at a red explosive barrel and it explodes at the perfect moment, taking all of them out? That's the TNT Target block.

The TNT Target's explosion will only damage mobs, and will not destroy blocks (as if detonating underwater), to assist in liberally scattering TNT Target blocks anywhere in your intricately decorated base/village during a Raid.

Speaking of which: TNT Target blocks explode with the equivalent firepower of a TNT on land, but if detonated underwater, the "water pressure" gives the depth charge an explosion power of a Supercharged Creeper. Do with that what you will.

It is crafted with **1 Target Block + 4 Gunpowder (surrounding) → 1 TNT Target**. It looks like an enchanted Target Block. Place it down like any other block, and though it looks like a regular Target Block when placed down, there will also be smoke particles and a fizzing sound. In the rare times where the raycasting fails to place the custom block, you will be given back the 4 Gunpowder used to craft the TNT Target.

#### TNT Target Block — Notes

The condition for a TNT Target block being "underwater" to explode with a Supercharged Creeper is that at least one of its sides must be adjacent to a water block (including seagrass, kelp, bubble columns etc.) and must have three blocks of water above it.

### Horn Quiver

> Arrows stack up to 127 items per slot in your inventory!

With the inventory management problem worsening with the growing number of new items in Minecraft, as well as change to make Power-enchanted Arrows deal less damage, there is a need for handling the stacks of arrows in your inventory.

It is crafted shapelessly with 1 Goat Horn + 1 Leather + 1 Rabbit Hide + 1 String → 1 Horn Quiver. First, hold the same arrow type in your mainhand and offhand at the same time, and then open your inventory. Pick up the Horn Quiver from your inventory and put it down in the inventory slot that you want the combined stack to combine into. The arrows from your mainland and offhand will stack into that slot up till 127 arrows, and any extra arrows will remain in your hands.

This gives an extra reason to get goat horns

Note that this over-stacking of arrows currently only applies to regular Arrows and Spectral Arrows, because the other (tipped) arrows and rockets are too overpowered to stack more than 64. (Imagine stacks of stacks of 127 Instant Damage II Tipped Arrows)

#### Horn Quiver — Caveats

Number one is that **any item slot/stack with a count of more than 64 will always act funny.** You'll quickly notice that picking up the over-stack of arrows and placing it back into your inventory slots will break the over-stack and revert it back to a max-64 stack: **you can't move the over-stack of arrows without breaking it.** Furthermore, new arrows of the same arrow type that you pick up won't join the over-stack (if you have 1 slot of 100 Arrows and you pick 1 more Arrow up, then you will have two slots, one at 100 Arrows and one at 1 Arrow: **new arrows don't join the over-stack.** You can use the number keys to move the over-stack around from your hotter, but that's about it. A custom max-stack count is way easier implemented with a mod.

Secondly, if the Horn Quiver leaves your inventory, the over-stack of arrows will remain stacked; there is no check to break the over-stack if the Horn Quiver is not in the inventory anymore, though it can certainly be implemented later on.

### Vanilla Arrows

> Minor Tweaks to vanilla arrows

Regular arrows are unchanged, they just have to be crafted through the Fletching Table instead of the Crafting Table.

Spectral Arrows have their recipe simplified from 1 Arrow surrounded by 4 Glowstone → 2 Spectral Arrows (Seriously, have you ever used this recipe?) to 1 Arrow + 1 Glowstone → 1 Spectral Arrow. To encourage the use of Spectral Arrows, glowing mobs now always drop 1 (extra) Glowstone Dust upon death if killed by a player, so they can craft even more Spectral Arrows.

Large credit to and permission granted by [Avexus02](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/avexus02/)'s [HeartDrops Data Pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/heartdrops/), to completely use its drop-item-at-mob-on-death code, unchanged! I spent a whole day trying to figure out how to do this. Thanks.

This is a complete rework of my previous [Improved Fletching Tables Data Pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/improved-fletching-tables/), and the two data packs are not meant to be compatible. Please uninstall the old data pack before using this one.

Reminder: this data pack was designed to work alongside my other data pack, [Cycle Offhand Arrows](https://github.com/chuangcaleb/cycle-offhand-arrows/), which allows you to**cycle through arrow types in the offhand slot by using your offhand key whilst holding a Bow or Crossbow**! With all these new arrows and improved bow mechanics, you will need this utility data pack!
